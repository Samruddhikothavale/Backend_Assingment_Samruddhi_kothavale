Code Review and Debugging

Identified Issues and there Impact

1.	Missing Error Handling 
Impact : Any database error or required field is missing from request ,the application will crash with KeyError and poor user experience.

2.	Lack of Input validation
Impact : given code directly uses input without checking its type or formate.this could lead to database error .

3.	Two different commit for relative task
Impact :if the Inventory commit fails ,the product will still be in database but not in Inventory record.
This will lead to inconsistent state of data.

4.	Missing validation for missing values
Impact:If the missing data is required key like name , there will be Key Error.

5.	No Http status code returned
Impcat:at each stage of handling there should be status retuen such as 200 Ok , 201 created etc.

6.	Missing validation for unique values
Impact:there are unique keys asuch as SKU in this given code should be unique within in bussines logic. This will lwad to a databse error ,incorrect inventory tracing for multiple products sharing same SKU.



Main Fixe Applied:
1.Removed double commit
2.Added rollback to cleanup failed transactions.
3.Status code added for better api communication
4.Input validation to ensure data integrity.
